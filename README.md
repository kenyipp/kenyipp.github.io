Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository! This repository contains
the source code for my personal portfolio website, which showcases my skills,
experience, and achievements.

The website is built using Next.js, a powerful JavaScript framework, and styled
using Mui, a versatile styling library. I have deployed the website to GitHub
Pages, making it easily accessible for anyone to explore.

Within the website, you will find comprehensive information about me, including
my professional experience, educational background, awards, and noteworthy side
projects.

For a hands-on demonstration of my skills, I encourage you to check out the side
projects section, where you can witness my abilities in action. Feel free to
browse the repository and delve into the intricacies of my portfolio website.
